          <p  id="para">  I am currently attending Sierra College, following CS(computer sciense Major. I have been serving as a  U.S Army soldier since a year and half ago. Before I became a soldier in the U.S Army I worked as a combat Translator/ Interpreter in Kandahar, Afghanistan. Moreover, now I am trying my best to complete my bachelors degree and hope to get a professional job as web developer or software engineer in near future. The moto that gives the motivation to keep going is "Fall 7, stand 8." I am a special fun of fitness and martial arts, thats why, I go to gym and run in the park near our home area when I find free time. I have practiced martial arts for 5 years and attended several tournaments. My acheivments of tournamnets are several medals. </p>
